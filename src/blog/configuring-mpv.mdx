## What is mpv?

mpv is a media player based on MPlayer and mplayer2. It supports a wide variety of video file formats, audio and video codecs, and subtitle types. You can download it from [here](https://mpv.io/installation/).

## Why mpv?

I have tried with VLC, PotPlayer, MPC-HC. I found that mpv is the best media player for me. It's lightweight, fast, and has a lot of features.

## My configuration

I use mpv on Windows, so I will show you my configuration on Windows under `portable_config` folder.
