My personal website's tech stack has gone though a lot,
from Hexo to Gatsby to Svelte and eventually to [Astro](https://astro.build).

My goal for my blog and personal website is that it should be fast, simple and intuitive. It can be static, and Astro successfully does this.

It even includes built-in support on markdown and scripts.

```javascript
// Example JavaScript

const x = 42
function returnAnswer() {
  return x
}
```
