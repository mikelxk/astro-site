It is no question that electron's default showing of titlebar and control buttons doesn't look good on Windows.

In this article, I will introduce a new feature in Electron [Windows Controls Overlay](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window_Controls_Overlay_API) that will make the titlebar look more native.

<h3 class="text-3xl font-bold">TL;DR</h3>

```js
const win = new BrowserWindow({
  titleBarStyle: "hidden",
  titleBarOverlay: {
    color: "#2f3241",
    symbolColor: "#74b1be",
    height: 60,
  },
})
```

To update the titlebar color, you can use the [win.setOverlayIcon(overlay, description)](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/browser-window#winsetoverlayiconoverlay-description-windows)
