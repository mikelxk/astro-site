## What is backtracking?

[Backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

Essentially, backtracking is dfs on a tree of possible solutions.

## Backtracking template

For a general backtracking, we need to write a base case for the end condition, a loop for the choices, and a recursive call.

```python
def backtrack(path, choices):
    if end_condition(path):
        return path
    for choice in choices:
        if is_valid(path, choice):
            path.add(choice)
            backtrack(path, choices)
            path.remove(choice)
```

You can remove the `path.add(choice)` and `path.remove(choice)` if you just add the choice to the path in the recursive call.

```python
backtrack(path + [choice], choices)
```

There are many variations of backtracking, such as the [subset sum problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem), [n-queens problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle), and [sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku).

## Variations

We can moidy the template to fit different problems.

### Permutations

### Combinations

### Duplicated input

### Multiple solutions on one path(Subsets)
